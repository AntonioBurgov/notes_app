# Notes Application

This is a simple full-stack web application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes. 
It is designed to demonstrate how a frontend built with **React + TypeScript** can communicate with a backend built using **Node.js**, **Express**, 
and **MySQL**.

The app runs entirely on your local machine.
